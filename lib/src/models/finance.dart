    title: 'UN climate chief asks G20 leaders for boost as finance talks lag',
    body:
        'By Kate Abnett and Valerie Volcovici\n\nBAKU (Reuters) - The U.N.\'s climate chief called on leaders of the world\'s biggest economies on Saturday to send a signal of support for global climate finance efforts when they meet in Rio de Janeiro next week.\n\nThe plea, made in a letter to G20 leaders from UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, comes as negotiators at the COP29 conference in Baku struggle in their negotiations for a deal intended to scale up money to address the worsening impacts of global warming.\n\n"Next week\'s summit must send crystal clear global signals," Stiell said in the letter.\n\nHe said the signal should support an increase in grants and loans, along with debt relief, so vulnerable countries "are not hamstrung by debt servicing costs that make bolder climate actions all but impossible".\n\nBusiness leaders echoed Stiell\'s plea, saying they were concerned about the "lack of progress and focus in Baku".\n\n"We call on governments, led by the G20, to meet the moment and deliver the policies for an accelerated shift from fossil fuels to a clean energy future, to unlock the essential private sector investment needed," said a coalition of business groups, including the We Mean Business Coalition, United Nations Global Compact and the Brazilian Council for Sustainable Development, in a separate letter.\n\nSuccess at this year\'s U.N. climate summit hinges on whether countries can agree on a new finance target for richer countries, development lenders and the private sector to deliver each year. Developing countries need at least \$1 trillion annually by the end of the decade to cope with climate change, economists told the U.N. talks.\n\nBut negotiators have made slow progress midway through the two-week conference. A draft text of the deal, which earlier this week was 33-pages long and comprised of dozens of wide-ranging options, had been pared down to 25 pages as of Saturday.\n\nSweden\'s climate envoy, Mattias Frumerie, told Reuters the finance negotiations had not yet cracked the toughest issues: how big the target should be, or which countries should pay.\n\n"The divisions we saw coming into the meeting are still there, which leaves quite a lot of work for ministers next week," he told Reuters.\n\nEuropean negotiators have said large oil-producing nations including Saudi Arabia are also blocking discussions on how to take forward last year\'s COP28 summit deal to transition the world away from fossil fuels.\n\nSaudi Arabia\'s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nProgress on this issue has been dire so far, one European negotiator told Reuters.\n\nUganda\'s energy minister, Ruth Nankabirwa, said her country\'s priority was to leave COP29 with a deal on affordable financing for clean energy projects.\n\n"When you look around and you don\'t have the money, then we keep wondering whether we will ever walk the journey of a real energy transition," she told Reuters.\n\n(Reporting by Kate Abnett, Valerie Volcovici, Simon Jessop; Editing by Frances Kerry)',

    title: 'There\'s a hidden risk lurking for AI stocks in 2025',
    body:
        'Companies are facing rising depreciation costs from their massive chip investments, Barclays says.\n\nBarclays warns these costs will significantly impact earnings estimates for top tech firms.\n\nDepreciation costs could lead to AI stock price declines and valuation scrutiny, according to Baird\'s Ted Mortonson.\n\nCompanies getting a boost from the booming AI trade are in a race against the clock to prove that their massive investments in GPU chips are paying off, but there\'s a little-talked-about issue that will make that endeavor even harder.\n\nDepreciation related to massive AI chip investments is the "not-so-hidden" cost of AI that few investors are factoring into their valuation analysis of these companies, analysts at Barclays said in a note earlier this year.\n\nDepreciation is an accounting method that allows companies to spread out the cost of a capital investment over its useful lifetime. That means that when a mega-cap tech company buys billions of dollars worth of GPU chips, it doesn\'t immediately record that as an expense, but rather as a capital expenditure.\n\nThat can lead to big profits upfront, as the capital outlays don\'t hit a company\'s profit and loss statement immediately but are rather recorded as a depreciation expense over the asset\'s useful lifetime.\n\nThe lurking problem is that the useful lifetime of AI GPU chips can be a lot shorter than many expect, especially as AI chips go through an ever-accelerating innovation cycle, leading to higher-than-expected depreciation expenses that ultimately drag down profits.\n\nThe depreciation costs related to GPU chips will be so big that Barclays is trimming its earnings estimates of cloud hyperscalers Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms by as much as 10% heading into next year.\n\n"Depreciation of AI compute assets is the biggest expense for these leading companies," Barclays internet analyst Ross Sandler said. "We think this is a risk that may rear its ugly head as we start looking ahead into 2025, so we are flagging it early."\n\nWith mega-cap tech companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on pricey GPU chips from the likes of Nvidia, massive depreciation costs will add up over the next few years, especially as Nvidia shifts to a new product launch cadence of one per year.\n\n"Because Nvidia has this very aggressive design cycle of roughly a year between major releases, all of those products have different skews and functionality and power profiles," Baird managing director and tech strategist Ted Mortonson told Business Insider last month.\n\n"It is a headwind," Morton said, adding that it is big enough to impact valuations and send AI stocks lower over the next year.\n\nBarclays estimates that Wall Street consensus is underestimating just how big the depreciation costs will be over the next two years.\n\nFor example, the bank expects Alphabet to record \$28 billion in depreciation costs in 2026, which is 24% more than current consensus estimates of \$22.6 billion.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the mismatch between Barclays\' depreciation estimate and Wall Street\'s is even further askew, at \$30.8 billion versus \$21.0 billion, respectively, representing potential costs being 47% higher than expected in 2026.\n\n"GOOGL, META, and AMZN shares are between 5% and 25% more expensive than the consensus estimates perceive given this mis-modeling, in our view," Barclays\' Sandler said.\n\nHe added: "While we don\'t think valuations are stretched vs. a historic bubble-y era like 2021, the AI boom has shined a brighter light on whether multiple expansion for big tech is warranted, so in light of this backdrop the depreciation (and hence valuation) disconnects are likely to be scrutinized."\n\nOne accounting method mega-cap tech CFOs are using is extending the useful life of their server assets from five years to six years or more, as that would spread out the costs over a longer time period and dampen the hit to earnings.\n\nBut even that has its limits because of how quickly Nvidia is releasing new GPU chips.\n\n"We don\'t see any mega cap extending useful life of servers after this 6-year schedule, as GPUs cycle times are increasing rapidly. The result of this is mega caps are likely to have to absorb the higher cost of depreciation expense going forward, unlike the last few years when there useful life tweaks were happening," Sandler explained.\n\nAnd for Mortonson, it all comes back to the return on invested AI capital.\n\n"Wall Street has a big question. They are now spending over \$200 billion and their CAPEX is over 50% up. Where is the return on invested capital?" Mortonson asked. "We\'re so early in this, that combined with all the accounting, it all wraps up to return on invested capital, and I don\'t think you see a return on invested capital till sometime in 2025 or 2026."\n\nMortonson added: "I think the jury is still out. I think the accountants got to take a hold of it, and there\'s got to be much more transparency between extending useful life of networking, storage, and servers versus GPUs. That\'s the bottom line."',

        '3 developments that could derail the stock market\'s post-Trump sugar high, BofA says',
    body:
        'Bank of America cited three risks that could upend corporate earnings growth, a key driver of stock returns.\n\nOne potential headwind is Trump\'s proposed tariff plan, BofA said.\n\nThe firm is also keep a close eye on bond yields, which have soared since the election.\n\nThe stock market has been riding high since Donald Trump won the presidential election.\n\nOne main driver of that has been investors pricing in strong profit growth in the future, seen as a direct byproduct of Trump\'s plans to cut the corporate tax rate and loosen regulation.\n\nAlthough Bank of America\'s year-end target for the S&P 500 is slightly above current levels, new research from the firm\'s equity-strategy team laid out three developments that could derail the ongoing "earnings-per-share upcycle" that\'s powering gains.\n\nFirst, an economic recession could significantly undercut earnings growth, drawing S&P EPS down 10% to 20%.\n\nThough a US downturn isn\'t BofA\'s base case, the bank cited that recession risk is a real possibility under incoming president Donald Trump.\n\nThat will depend on which policies the incoming administration prioritizes, analysts wrote in a separate note. In a scenario where Trump pushes dramatic immigration curbs and protectionist trade policies amid minimal fiscal easing, the economy would sink into recession.\n\nPeak-to-trough profit drawdowns of 20% are typical in an average recession. Under this scenario, EPS would drop to \$195-\$220 next year.\n\nTo be sure, BofA also sees chances of blowout growth, if the president-elect de-emphasizes trade and immigration restrictions in favor of tax cuts and deregulation. In this case, GDP growth could even exceed 3% in 2025.\n\nSecond, if Trump\'s trade plans are implemented, retaliatory tariffs could trigger a 10% hit to EPS.\n\nDuring his campaign, the president-elect pledged to implement a 10% duty on all foreign imports into the US. That wouldn\'t apply to Chinese products, which would face a 60% rate instead.\n\nIf Trump stays true to his word, BofA expects US foreign sales to take on a 3% to 4% hit as the rest of the world establishes its own retaliatory tariffs.\n\nIn the mounting trade war, industrials and semiconductor stocks would be most at risk, the bank said.\n\nThird, a dramatic upswing in bond yields could slash EPS by another 10%.\n\nBofA\'s worst-case scenario would be if the 10-year Treasury yield surges to 7%, a situation that could be prompted if Trump\'s tariff and immigration reductions spark an inflation shock.\n\nIf this were to happen, the yield jump implies that the Purchasing Managers Index would hit 43 by 2024\'s year-end.\n\nThis measure monitors the health of US manufacturing and indicates a contraction whenever its reading stands below 50. As of October, PMI registered a 46.5 level.\n\nWhile a contracting manufacturing base would cut into EPS, higher bond yields could also weigh on equity exposure. BofA noted that stocks could face increased pressure once the 10-year rate rises above 5%.\n\nThe yield has been climbing higher amid Trump\'s election, as uncertainty has grown over whether the Federal Reserve can cut rates amid the president-elect\'s policies. The 10-year rate is currently trading above 4.5%.',

    title: '3 Ways the Trump Administration Could Change the Future of Crypto',
    body:
        'Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has to surges to new all-time highs since the presidential election, rising nearly 30% and trading near the \$90,000 mark. Some investors now think that Bitcoin could break through the \$100,000 mark before Donald Trump is even inaugurated as the next U.S. president.\n\nObviously, the market is sending a signal that Trump\'s election win is good for crypto. But what exactly does that mean in practical terms? Here\'s a closer look at three key ways that a Trump administration could change the future of crypto.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »\n\nA new pro-business environment for crypto\nOn the campaign trail, Trump told his supporters that he wanted to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the world." That starts with making the country a place where crypto companies and crypto investors want to do business. And that, most likely, means a fundamental rethinking of the regulatory landscape for crypto, which now is dominated by the Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC).\n\nSince the SEC has often voiced its concerns about crypto, that has made it difficult, if not impossible, for some companies to do business. Take Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), for example. It has been fighting the SEC on a range of different issues related to crypto, and has even hinted that it might take some of its business offshore to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions.\n\nThat\'s the case, too, with Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) crypto token. It, too, has been engaged in an epic battle with the SEC, and it has been forced to take some of its business overseas. Meanwhile, the price of XRP continues to languish at less than \$1 amid regulatory uncertainty.\n\nIn 2025, look for Congress to pass favorable new crypto legislation. Sentiment appears to be shifting in Washington, and this legislation has bipartisan support. At the very least, Trump has pledged to replace the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, with someone who is more friendly to crypto.\n\nCreation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve\nAnother history-making move would be the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. As envisioned now, this would require the U.S. to buy 1 million bitcoins during the next five years. By the end of that time, the U.S. would own about 5% of all Bitcoin in circulation, making it a crypto superpower.\n\nWhere things get interesting is when you consider what could be done with that strategic Bitcoin reserve. You can think of it as being similar to the nation\'s Strategic Petroleum Reserve: a backup resource that can be used during extraordinary times to stabilize the economy. From time to time, the U.S. might be able to dip into its Bitcoin holdings to achieve certain economic goals.\n\nThe really big idea is to use the strategic Bitcoin reserve as a way to pare the nation\'s \$35 trillion debt load. If the price of Bitcoin increases exponentially -- as some investors think it will -- then some of those crypto gains might be used to pay down that debt. For example, if Bitcoin does skyrocket to a price of \$1 million, as Cathie Wood of Ark Invest has suggested it might, those 1 million bitcoins would be worth \$1 trillion.\n\nThe good news is that there is already legislation ready to go. Known as the BITCOIN Act of 2024, it was introduced this summer by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), when President-elect Trump was still on the campaign trail. As soon as Trump won the election, Senator Lummis sent an enthusiastic post on social media: "We are going to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve."\n\nA revamped Bitcoin mining industry\nPresident Trump has suggested that he\'ll work with the nation\'s Bitcoin miners to ensure that all Bitcoin mined in the future is mined domestically. If you listen to some of Trump\'s speeches from the campaign trail, it\'s clear that he views Bitcoin mining the same way he views coal mining: It creates jobs, it stimulates economic growth, and it can be an economic lifesaver for rural communities located near cheap energy sources.\nSo what would a new strategic initiative related to Bitcoin mining look like? The speculation now is that it will be folded into a much larger initiative related to national energy policy. That could include an upgrade of the nation\'s energy grid. And it could include less emphasis on clean energy being used for the energy-intensive Bitcoin mining process. As a result, the cost of producing new Bitcoin could become cheaper. If that happens, Bitcoin mining stocks could soar in 2025.\n\nHow realistic are these pro-crypto policies?\nJust keep in mind: Campaign promises do not always come to fruition. So it\'s easy to see how some of the bolder crypto-related initiatives supported by Trump -- such as the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve -- might not happen.\n\nAnd it\'s still not clear what role some of the pro-crypto advocates supporting Trump, such as Elon Musk, will play in the new Trump Administration. Will Musk, for example, find a way to use Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) within the planned Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)?\n\nOverall, though, it\'s hard not to see how the new policies under consideration will be positive for crypto, and especially Bitcoin. CNBC is already calling this the Trump trade: You buy crypto because you think Trump will be positive, and you don\'t overthink it.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested \$1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have \$23,818!*\n\nApple: if you invested \$1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have \$43,221!*\n\nNetflix: if you invested \$1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have \$451,527!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.',

    title: 'Bitwise Seeks to Convert \$1.3B Crypto Index to ETP',
    body:
        'Bitwise Asset Management has announced that NYSE Arca has filed a Form 19b-4 to uplist the \$1.3 billion Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) as an ETP, joining a growing trend of crypto asset managers seeking to convert investment vehicles into exchange-traded structures.\n\n“Bitwise believes that ETPs are among the most efficient, convenient, and useful vehicles for providing crypto exposure,” Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said in the announcement. “We remain committed to converting BITW to an ETP.”\n\nBITW, which launched in November 2017 as the world’s first crypto index fund, provides investors exposure to diversified portfolio of digital assets, with shares currently quoted on the OTCQX Best Market, according to the release.\n\nThe current fund holds 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin comprising 74.8% of the portfolio, followed by Ethereum at 16.2%, and Solana at 4.4%, according to its fund page. The remaining allocations are spread across smaller cryptocurrencies including XRP, Cardano, and Avalanche.\n\nExpanding Crypto Access\nThe conversion effort aims to enhance the fund’s efficiency and regulatory protections, according to the announcement. An ETP structure would accept subscriptions and redemptions at net asset value, creating an arbitrage mechanism that could help the fund trade more closely to its underlying value.\n\nThe fund currently trades at \$52 while having a net asset value of \$62, highlighting the premium/discount issues that a conversion is intended to address.\n\nThe filing follows Grayscale’s recent move to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund into an ETF structure. Grayscale has already successfully converted its bitcoin and Ethereum trusts into ETFs earlier this year.\n\nRead More: Grayscale Seeks SEC Nod for Multi-Crypto ETF Conversion\n\nBITW currently charges a 2.5% expense ratio and has generated returns of 50.2% over the past month and 108.9% year-to-date in secondary market trading, compared to 30% and 81.8%, respectively, for its underlying crypto index, according to the fund page.\n\nIf successful, the conversion would represent another milestone in Bitwise’s efforts to broaden access to cryptocurrency investments through regulated vehicles. The company first registered BITW as a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company in April 2021, providing additional transparency for investors, the release noted.',

        'Bank Clients Just Dipped Their Toes Into Bitcoin ETFs, but Q4 Could See a FOMO Spike',
    body:
        'Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and other Wall Street banks continued buying shares of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds on behalf of clients.\n\nWhile allocations barely changed, most likely due to uneventful price action in bitcoin, the fourth quarter could see renewed interest sparked by recent new all-time highs.\n\nWealth management clients of Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley in the third quarter continued to modestly accumulate (or trade) bitcoin {{BTC}} via spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Given the huge spike in crypto prices following last week\'s U.S. presidential election, it\'s possible the action will perk up in the fourth quarter.\n\n"The 13F filings mirror the tepid price action in bitcoin in Q3," said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. "Most institutions are slow to deploy capital and to observe trends, and didn\'t take the initiative to front-run a historically bullish Q4."\n\nGoldman Sachs reported holding spot bitcoin ETF shares worth \$710 million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, as clients\' allocations into the ETFs nearly doubled, up from \$418 million in the previous quarter. Most of the bank\'s shares were in BlackRock\'s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), in which it held just shy of 13 million shares.\n\nOther top-tier banks/wealth management operations, including Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of America, UBS and HSBC, didn\'t add to or subtract much from their positions. A new entrant was Australian investment bank Macquarie Group, which purchased 132,355 shares of IBIT worth \$4.8 million. Wells Fargo, which has a very minor stake in the ETFs, held most of its shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC).\n\nThe positions were reported in 13F filings, a quarterly report that institutional investors with over \$100 million in assets under management are required to file to disclose their holdings of certain securities. The deadline for the third quarter was Thursday.\n\nBlackRock disclosed a stake of 2.54 million shares, worth \$91.6 million as of Sept. 30, in its own fund.\n\nThe three-month period from the start of July to the end of September signaled a period of flat to downward price action for bitcoin, with the price largely ranging from \$53,000 to \$66,000. This followed the flat to downward price action during much of the second quarter, so it\'s possible the tepid institutional interest reflected the pall that sat over the market.\n\nThings, of course, have changed in a big way in the fourth quarter amid the run-up to and following the election of crypto-friendly Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. Bitcoin blasted out of its multi-month range, quickly taking out March\'s record of \$73,700 and continuing this week to as high as \$93,400.\n\nThe recent price action, combined with a hoped-for crypto embrace by the Trump administration taking office in January might inspire a good deal of "fear of missing out" (FOMO) in institutional players and their clients. It\'s at least somewhat possible the next batch of 13Fs coming after the start of 2025 could prove far more interesting than this quarter\'s.\n\n"I expect a lot of scrambling behind the scenes to make sure institutions have at the bare minimum a 1% allocation due to crypto-friendly president Donald Trump and bitcoin breaking," van Straten said.',

    title: 'Millennium, Capula, Tudor pile bitcoin ETFs into portfolios',
    body:
        'By Carolina Mandl\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge funds including Millennium Management, Capula Management and Tudor Investment increased their exposure to U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the third quarter, securities filings showed, as a popular election-driven arbitrage trade ramped up.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising friendly regulation and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. The cryptocurrency surpassed the \$90,000 level to reach an all-time high earlier this week, although it has pared gains.\n\nDuring the election price volatility, some hedge funds have been taking advantage of a price difference between spot bitcoin and its derivatives in the futures market in a leveraged trade, according to analysts. Spot ETFs were approved by the Securities and Exchanged Commission earlier this year.\n\nIn the so-called bitcoin basis trade, investors buy spot bitcoin - or its ETFs - and short the cryptocurrency futures, which have been trading at substantially higher prices this year. This gap widened after the election result and on Nov. 11 reached 17% in an annual basis, CF Bitcoin data showed, but pared gains to 12% on Friday.\n\n"Hedge funds are harvesting that spread. It creates a very tactical, opportunistic trade," said Gabe Selby, head of research at Kraken\'s CF Benchmarks. "It has an uncorrelated return."\n\nPositions unveiled in 13-F filings this week only show long equity bets placed by hedge funds and not wagers on the fall of share prices or derivatives. Reuters could not determine whether specific hedge funds were putting on such an arbitrage bet, only if they have taken long positions.\n\nAmong those that increased their exposure to the cryptocurrency was Israel Englander\'s Millennium, which more than doubled its number of shares in iShares Bitcoin Trust to 23.5 million shares, worth \$849 million, from the previous quarter. It also increased its positions in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin and Bitwise Bitcoin funds.\n\nOverall, the New York-based hedge fund ended September with \$1.7 billion in crypto ETFs, including spot bitcoin and ethereum funds. The ETFs account for a small portion of the firm\'s \$70 billion in assets under management.\n\nCapula, a London-based macro hedge fund, also added more shares in iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, according to an SEC filing on Thursday. Those positions totaled roughly \$600 million.\n\nPaul Tudor Jones\' hedge fund Tudor turbocharged its exposure to iShares Bitcoin Trust fund, increasing its number of shares by five times, to 4.4 million.\n\nSchonfeld Strategic Partners is also a hedge fund that added more shares in bitcoin funds.\n\nMillennium and Tudor declined to comment on their positions. The other hedge funds did not immediately comment on the matter.\n\nIf hedge funds kept their positions through the fourth quarter, they could be poised to post big gains. Since the end of September, spot bitcoin ETFs are up roughly 40%, mainly driven by the result of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nGiven bitcoin\'s more volatile price, many hedge funds prefer more neutral trades that do not take a directional bet on its rise or fall.\n\nDavid Duong, Coinbase\'s institutional head of research, said the bitcoin basis trade has climbed for the last few weeks. "Leading into the election, we had multiple clients actually requesting increases in their credit lines (to trade)," he added.\n\n(Reporting by Carolina Mandl in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)',

However, Equinix also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nEquinix\'s dividend yield is currently 1.89%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about \$117.72 in dividends per share, which means you could have made \$5,303 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up \$40,598 and \$5,303, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is \$45,901. This is how much you could have made if you had invested \$10,000 in Equinix stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 359.01%. In comparison, S&P 500 total return for the same period is 233.31%.\n\nTrending: During market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses.\n\nWhat Could The Next 10 Years Bring?\nEquinix has a consensus rating of "Buy" and a price target of \$882.07 based on the ratings of 31 analysts. The price target implies more than 2% potential downside from the current stock price.\n\nOn Oct. 30, the company announced its Q3 2024 earnings, posting an AFFO of \$9.05, beating the consensus estimate of \$8.70 and revenues of \$2.20 billion, matching expectations, as reported by Benzinga.\n\n“Our 87th consecutive quarter of revenue growth was also a record-breaking one for gross bookings, with strong results across our three regions. This performance is a testament to the trust our customers place in Equinix and the value they realize in partnering strategically with us. We see continued robust demand for AI-enabling digital infrastructure from a highly diverse set of customers of varying sizes, industries and regions," said Adaire Fox-Martin, CEO and President of Equinix.\n\nSee Also: Wondering if your investments can get you to a \$5,000,000 nest egg?

Conversely, the stock can be a good option for income-focused investors, who can benefit from the company\'s solid dividend yield of 1.89% and consistent hikes. Equinix has raised its dividend consecutively for the last eight years.\n\nCheck out this article by Benzinga for three more stocks offering high dividend yields.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities In A Shifting Market?\nThe changing interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

    title: 'Retail sales rise in hint of cheer for holiday consumer spending',

        'This story was originally published on CFO Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO Dive newsletter.\n\nDive Brief:\nRetail sales rose 0.4% last month compared with September and 2.8% in the year since October 2023, the Commerce Department said Friday, signaling the possibility of solid consumer spending during the coming holiday season.\n\nAmong the 13 retail categories, eight registered stronger sales, including autos, food service and drinking places, and electronics and appliance stores, the Commerce Department reported. Sales declined the most at furniture stores, miscellaneous retailers and health and personal care stores.\n\n“Growth in consumer spending has remained strong, supported by increases in disposable income and solid household balance sheets,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday in a speech.\n\nDive Insight:\nRecent signs of robust consumer spending, solid hiring and persistent inflation prompted traders in interest rate futures to reduce the odds that the Fed will cut the main interest rate by a quarter percentage point at its next meeting in December. They saw a 58% probability of such a reduction compared with 72% on Thursday.\n\nDefying forecasts of recession, GDP grew at annual rates of 1.4% in Q1, 3% in Q2 and 2.8% in Q3, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. GDP will probably expand at a 2.5% annual rate during the fourth quarter, the Atlanta Fed said Friday.\n\n“The economy is in a very good place now, and inflation is coming back down to target, the labor markets are healthy and we’re seeing solid growth,” Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Friday on Bloomberg Television, echoing comments by Powell on Thursday.\n\nReferring to monetary policy, Collins also aligned with Powell, saying “we’re not on a present path, and so we’ll have to look carefully at the data and see what makes sense when we get to Dec. 18,” the last day of a two-day meeting of policymakers.\n\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Friday the central bank has far to go in reducing interest rates so that currently restrictive monetary policy neither slows nor spurs economic growth.\n\n“I still think we have a long way to go down with rates,” Goolsbee said in a Bloomberg Television interview. The central bank cut the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage points in September and by 0.25 percentage points this month to a range between 4.5% to 4.75%.\n\nWhen policymakers meet, “everything\'s always on the table,” Goolsbee said. “But there are no guarantees, and there shouldn\'t be.”\n\nFueling about 70% of economic growth, consumer spending has blown through predictions of a slump, propelled by solid wage gains and rising sentiments among U.S. households.\n\nConsumer optimism in the strength of the economy six months in the future hit the highest level since July 2021, with expectations for personal finances rising 6%, according to a November survey by the University of Michigan.\n\nConsumer sentiment increased 3.5% to the highest reading in six months, and expectations for short-run business conditions jumped 9%, according to Joanne Hsu, director of the university’s consumer survey.\n\nLast month the mood among consumers improved more than any month since March 2021, the Conference Board said in a report on its Consumer Confidence Index.\n\nAll five components of the index improved, including consumers’ assessments of current business conditions, the availability of jobs, future business conditions, future income and the future availability of jobs, the Conference Board said.',

        'Bank Clients Just Dipped Their Toes Into Bitcoin ETFs, but Q4 Could See a FOMO Spike',
    body:
        'Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and other Wall Street banks continued buying shares of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds on behalf of clients.\n\nWhile allocations barely changed, most likely due to uneventful price action in bitcoin, the fourth quarter could see renewed interest sparked by recent new all-time highs.\n\nWealth management clients of Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley in the third quarter continued to modestly accumulate (or trade) bitcoin {{BTC}} via spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Given the huge spike in crypto prices following last week\'s U.S. presidential election, it\'s possible the action will perk up in the fourth quarter.\n\n"The 13F filings mirror the tepid price action in bitcoin in Q3," said James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk. "Most institutions are slow to deploy capital and to observe trends, and didn\'t take the initiative to front-run a historically bullish Q4."\n\nGoldman Sachs reported holding spot bitcoin ETF shares worth \$710 million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, as clients\' allocations into the ETFs nearly doubled, up from \$418 million in the previous quarter. Most of the bank\'s shares were in BlackRock\'s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), in which it held just shy of 13 million shares.\n\nOther top-tier banks/wealth management operations, including Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of America, UBS and HSBC, didn\'t add to or subtract much from their positions. A new entrant was Australian investment bank Macquarie Group, which purchased 132,355 shares of IBIT worth \$4.8 million. Wells Fargo, which has a very minor stake in the ETFs, held most of its shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC).\n\nThe positions were reported in 13F filings, a quarterly report that institutional investors with over \$100 million in assets under management are required to file to disclose their holdings of certain securities. The deadline for the third quarter was Thursday.\n\nBlackRock disclosed a stake of 2.54 million shares, worth \$91.6 million as of Sept. 30, in its own fund.\n\nThe three-month period from the start of July to the end of September signaled a period of flat to downward price action for bitcoin, with the price largely ranging from \$53,000 to \$66,000. This followed the flat to downward price action during much of the second quarter, so it\'s possible the tepid institutional interest reflected the pall that sat over the market.\n\nThings, of course, have changed in a big way in the fourth quarter amid the run-up to and following the election of crypto-friendly Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency. Bitcoin blasted out of its multi-month range, quickly taking out March\'s record of \$73,700 and continuing this week to as high as \$93,400.\n\nThe recent price action, combined with a hoped-for crypto embrace by the Trump administration taking office in January might inspire a good deal of "fear of missing out" (FOMO) in institutional players and their clients. It\'s at least somewhat possible the next batch of 13Fs coming after the start of 2025 could prove far more interesting than this quarter\'s.\n\n"I expect a lot of scrambling behind the scenes to make sure institutions have at the bare minimum a 1% allocation due to crypto-friendly president Donald Trump and bitcoin breaking," van Straten said.',
